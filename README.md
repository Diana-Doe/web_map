This program uses the dataset with movies, their locations and years of their release and finds movies 
which were filmed near users location. Then it uses folium to create an HTML file with a map with icons 
of movies places and user place. Also, it contains mini-map and roads and shows the distance between user and movie locations. 
####
This program require a few python libraries:
#
>pip install geopy
#
>pip install folium
#
>pip install reverse_geocoder
